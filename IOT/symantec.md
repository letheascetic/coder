IoT security can be covered with four cornerstones: 

* Protecting Communications

> encryption and authentication for devices to know whether or not they can trust a remote system
> elliptic curve cryptography
> embedded “device certificate” keys

* Protecting Devices

> code signing, to be sure all code is authorized to run, it can be done at “application” and “firmware” levels 
> run-time protection, to be sure malicious attacks don’t overwrite code after it is loaded, host based protections

* Managing Devices

> updates required
> over-the air (OTA) manageability must be built into devices before they ship.

* Understanding Your System

> an IoT Security Analytics capability that helps you best understand your network
